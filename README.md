# Booker iOS


iOS Front end to room booking application for Box UK hack event.

## Classes
* Room
    Represents a Room - Has a name.
* Booking
    Represents a Booking - Has a Room, start time and end time.

Will pull data from web service to put in to these classes.

## Testing
Write tests using OCUnit. Would be nice to write integration tests. Frank is a good framework. No CI support as yet, Jenkins hates XCode.

## Usage
Carefully.

But, if you really want to get it running:

1. Download the git repo.
2. Run `pod install` in the root directory
3. Run it and see what happens!

## Licence
All right reserved.
